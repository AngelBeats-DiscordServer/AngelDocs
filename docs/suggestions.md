!!! important "Student Council only."
    This section is only relevent to those in the Student Council.

Suggestions are a way for the community to... give suggestions, as well as report problems, partnership applications, and more. It utilizes CarlBot.

### Workflow

!!! note
    A working example outside of the Angel Beats! server can be found on CarlBot's help server, which is what our workflow is based on. You can access their server by using [this invite link](https://discord.gg/DSg744v).
	
	Further more, any actions we take (by using commands with CarlBot), will be publicly visible in #suggestions-log, **and** CarlBot will message the user that made the suggestion with an update.

#### 1. User makes a suggestion.

A user makes a suggestion and this will get posted to `#suggestions`. Suggestions are posted anonymously to allow us to recieve complaints without fear of repercussions. It will include up/downvote arrows with it and there isn't a way to turn those off. It does allow us to see how well the rest of the community does, or does not like the suggestion. We don't need to take those votes into consideration either.

We should encourage all users to use the suggestions function if there should be **any** changes to the server, or **any** commands that need to be ran by someone on the Student Council. 

#### 2. Consider or Deny.

We don't need to respond to everything straight away. Some things may need time for us to investigate, or wait for the community to voice their input. It may be used as a 'to do' list for us to get around to, eventually.

##### Consider
If the suggestion is good, but we need more time to consider or look into it, mark it as being considered. Doing this will:

* Send the suggesting user an update saying we are considering their suggestion.
* Make a post in `#suggestions-log`, marking that we are considering the suggestion.
* Update the original post in `#suggestions` marking that we are considering the suggestion.

Marking a suggestion as considered does not mean it cannot be denied later.

Use/example:
```
??consider <ID> <Reason>
??consider 15 nice idea, will look into it
```

##### Deny
If the suggestion is abuse, not possible, a duplicate, or any other reason why we would not do the suggestion, mark it as denied. Just like being considered, doing this will:

* Send the suggesting user an update saying we are considering their suggestion.
* Make a post in `#suggestions-log`, marking that we are considering the suggestion.
* Update the original post in `#suggestions` marking that we are considering the suggestion.

**Denying a suggestion does not permently close it.** It's status can be changed by anyone else on the Student Council at any time. Give a reasonable reason for why it has been denied. Addationally, marking a suggestion as denied does not mean it cannot be approved later.
